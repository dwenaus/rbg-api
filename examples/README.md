Booking Guru API Examples
=========================

This directory contains some examples for using the Booking Guru REST API.

If you don't have a Booking Guru install on `secure.retreat.guru`, please sign up for one on https://bookingsoftware.guru/.

Before running the samples, please configure the following environment variables with your install's domain name and API token:

    $ export RGDOMAIN=<domain>.secure.retreat.guru
    $ export RGTOKEN=<token>

To get the token, go to your install's *Reg. Settings* and find it in the *API* tab.

If you don't have an *API* tab in *Reg. Settings*, it means the API has not been enabled for your install. Please contact us on https://intercom.help/retreatguru and we'll set you up.

This directory is organized according to programming language. Each programming language needs to be installed and configured but you probably know how to do that.
